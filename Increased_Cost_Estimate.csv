"With the increased budget, I added back in the S3 storage and data transfer that I had previously reduced plus additional storage and data transfer",,,,,,,
out to ensure users can access posts for a longer time period. I also changed the RDS to multi-AZ and added a read replica to each AZ in the region (6 total),,,,,,,
to decrease read times and improve RTO/RPO in the event of a single AZ outage. I increased the upper EC2 cap for autoscaling and reverted to a M5.large to increase ,,,,,,,
performance as well.  ,,,,,,,
